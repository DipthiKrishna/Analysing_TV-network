Introduction
In this project, we are investigating to find out how some of the elements of the TV show interact with each other. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook, which can be found in the Notebook directory. This readme provides instructions on setting up the environment, downloading the required datasets, and running the notebook.

Getting Started
To get started with running the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DipthiKrishna/Analysing_TV_network.git
Environment Setup: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies. Use the package manager conda or virtualenv to create an isolated environment.

bash
Copy code
conda create -n project-env python=3.8
conda activate project-env
Install the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Follow these steps to run the Jupyter Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook: In your terminal, navigate to the repository's directory and launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Notebook: In your web browser, access the Jupyter Notebook interface and navigate to the Notebook directory. Open the TV_notebook.ipynb notebook.

Run the Notebook: Within the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

Data Sets
This project relies on the following datasets:

super_bowls Dataset:
Description: This dataset contains information about all the Super Bowl games, including details like the teams that played, the date and location of the game, the winning team, and the MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the game.
Use Case: The Super Bowls dataset can be used to analyze trends in Super Bowl games over the years, such as team performance, game locations, and MVPs.

TV Dataset:
Description: The TV dataset provides viewership and advertising information for each Super Bowl broadcast. It includes details like the average number of viewers, the TV network broadcasting the game, the total number of commercials, and the average cost of a commercial spot during the broadcast.
Use Case: This dataset can be utilized to examine viewership trends for Super Bowl broadcasts, advertising costs, and the impact of different networks on viewership.

Halftime Musicians Dataset:
Description: The halftime musicians dataset contains information about the artists and bands that performed during the halftime shows of various Super Bowl games. It includes details such as the number of Super Bowls played , the performer(s), and the music played.
Use Case: This dataset is useful for analyzing trends in halftime show performances, such as popular genres, recurring performers, and any notable changes in the halftime show entertainment.

Download the datasets and place them in the data directory.

Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook, TV_notebook.ipynb, is where the main analysis is performed. This notebook contains the step-by-step code and explanations for the analysis.
